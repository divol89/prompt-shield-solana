Copy and post these to start the momentum while I fix the autonomous connection:

## Post 1: The Teaser (X/Twitter)
"Most AI Security is broken. If you can speak Chinese or use Base64, your firewall fails. We built something different: Inverse Entropy Analysis. 🛡️ 

Try to break it at the Jailbreak Challenge: http://localhost:4000 (Coming to Public URL soon!) 

#AISecurity #LLM #PromptInjection"

## Post 2: The Technical Authority (LinkedIn/Threads)
"Why 'Keyword Filtering' is dead in the age of LLMs. 🧠

Today with @krypto_minro, we implemented a proprietary core reasoning engine that predicts an attack's impact before it reaches the AI. 

No more language-based vulnerabilities. 5ms latency. Zero Trust. 🚀"

## Post 3: The Challenge (Dev Communities)
"I dare any hacker to bypass the Prompt Shield proprietary engine. It doesn't just look at your question; it predicts the answer. If the simulation results in a data leak, you are CANCELLED. ❌ 

Beta SDK open for first 50 AI Startups. DM for access."
