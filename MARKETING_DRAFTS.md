# Marketing Drafts: Prompt Shield

## Thread 1: The "Inverse" Secret of AI Security
1/7 Most AI firewalls are just a list of "forbidden words". That's a mistake. If I speak Chinese or use Base64, the filter breaks. Here's how we solved it with @krypto_minro. 🛡️ #AISecurity #PromptInjection

2/7 We use **Inverse Structural Analysis**. Instead of looking at *what* the prompt says, we look at *how* it's built. 

3/7 High Entropy? Suspicious symbols? Delimiter manipulation? These are the fingerprints of a jailbreak, regardless of language. 

4/7 We've integrated this into our **Guardian & Shadow** dual-neuron engine. Guardian checks compliance; Shadow thinks like a hacker to find the exploit.

5/7 The result? Sub-5ms latency and a defense that doesn't care if you're using Unicode, Homoglyphs, or Chinese. 

6/7 We're opening a few Beta spots for our SDK. High-performance security for your LLM agents.

7/7 Try to break us at our Jailbreak Challenge: [Link] (Coming soon to public URL). Follow us to stay protected. 🚀
